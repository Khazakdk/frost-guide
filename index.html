  <h1><span>10.1 Breath of Sindragosa Guide for Frost Death
      Knights</span></h1>
  <p><span>By Khazakdk</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Introduction</span></h2>
  <h3 ><span>Who is this guide for?</span></h3>
  <p><span>This guide is targeted towards players who are newer to the spec or long time Frost
      players who have avoided the Breath of Sindragosa build.</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h3 ><span>What does this guide cover?</span></h3>
  <p><span>This guide will primarily focus on Breath of Sindragosa gameplay, with smaller portions
      focused on gear and talents. &nbsp;Other guides and resources sufficiently cover those subjects. &nbsp;My main
      focus here will be teaching how to actually play the spec in PvE content with the aim of reducing some
      misconceptions about the builds. &nbsp;Many players feel that BoS is either a 1 button playstyle that is too
      boring or is too punishing on the player for dealing with mechanics. &nbsp;</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h3 ><span>Who am I?</span></h3>
  <p><span>My name is Khazak, Acherus moderator and a Death Knight main since I started playing in
      5.4. &nbsp;Some notable contributions include working on the DK simc module and writing the Frost and Unholy
      modules for WoWAnalyzer. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>

  <p><span>This is the build you will be using the vast majority of the time in raid content.
      &nbsp;In order to achieve the pathing needed to pick up all the throughput you will lose nearly all flexibility in
      the class tree. &nbsp;There are a few points where you can flex that I will highlight.</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <p><span>The biggest flex point is if you are doing content that has no significant magic
      damage, making AMZ an unused button. &nbsp;This opens up Blinding Sleet, Coldthirst, and Improved Death
      Strike.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Blinding Sleet is a good pickup in all keys, and can be taken in raid if
        the fight calls for it.</span></li>
    <li><span>Coldthirst is the first thing you look to take if you drop AMZ.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span>Improved Death Strike is very strong in the right situations.
        &nbsp;It&rsquo;s primary benefit to Frost is the rp cost reduction. &nbsp;I would only look at this in
        m+.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <p><span>With these points considered, I default to the following class tree for Frost M+</span>

  <p><span>This is a relatively rigid tree. &nbsp;There are some essential nodes we must path to,
      I have marked those in green. &nbsp;We are left with essentially 3 non mandatory points, Fatal Fixation, and 2/2
      Bonegrinder. &nbsp;Breath has only a few places it can really spend these.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Chill Streak + one of its upgrades. &nbsp;In 2T content, this is hands
        down the best thing you can pick. &nbsp;The problem is there is a severe lack of 2T content available to us
        right now. &nbsp;Frostwyrm&rsquo;s Fury will scale better into higher target counts, and CS is useless in
        ST.</span></li>
    <li><span>Frostwhelp&rsquo;s Indignation. &nbsp;Solid if you can hit 4-5 targets
        with each pillar. &nbsp;Unfortunately a bit too expensive at 2 points to justify taking right now.</span></li>
    <li><span>Frostwyrm&rsquo;s Fury. &nbsp;One point into FWF is better than 2/2
        Bonegrinder in multi target content. &nbsp;Very solid and usually the first thing you look to swap to.</span>
    </li>
    <li><span>2/2 Bonegrinder. &nbsp;Bonegrinder is a bit of a one point wonder, as
        the crit effect does not scale with points spent, only the frost damage does. &nbsp;In multi target situations
        you will usually look to drop a point here for something like FWF.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Present a default build</span></li>
    <li><span>Walk through situations where it makes sense to go into AZ/CS/Drop
        Horn</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Why play Breath?</span></h2>
  <p><span>Breath&rsquo;s uniqueness comes from its dynamic gameplay. &nbsp;Instead of being a
      scripted cooldown, your rotation priority changes based on your resources while BoS is rolling. &nbsp;Our goal
      during BoS is to extend it as long as possible without otherwise sacrificing throughput. &nbsp;This is done by
      generating Runic Power as efficiently as possible, which is done by managing Runes well. &nbsp;The dynamic element
      is primarily enabled by the passive Runic Empowerment giving BoS a powerful feedback loop. &nbsp;By spending Runic
      Power off the gcd, BoS is able to significantly increase its Rune regeneration rate, which will in turn generate
      more Runic Power to fuel BoS. &nbsp;BoS is also able to freely cleave onto other targets while not sacrificing any
      priority target damage, something that is typically very valuable in progression raiding. &nbsp; </span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Why not to play Breath?</span></h2>
  <p><span>Breath is currently in something of an identity crisis. &nbsp;For years it performed at
      its best when it lasted 25-45 seconds. &nbsp;Having a high impact 2 minute cooldown with a dynamic playstyle
      attracted players to the spec as it enabled an interesting playstyle where players could look at a fight and
      figure out when to most effectively use cooldowns. &nbsp;Currently, BoS does not fit that identity. &nbsp;It is a
      spec that demands constant uptime, using CDs almost as soon as you can, and has one of the highest amounts of RNG
      of all the DPS specs. &nbsp;This makes BoS often feel out of the player&rsquo;s control, which most players find
      frustrating. &nbsp; &nbsp; </span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Abilities and Rotation</span></h2>
  <h3 ><span>Priority list inside BoS</span></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Remorseless Winter</span></li>
    <li><span>Howling Blast with Rime if RP &gt; 45 OR RP &gt; 37 with RotFC</span>
    </li>
    <li><span>Horn of Winter if you have less than 2 Runes and will not waste
        RP</span></li>
    <li><span>Obliterate. &nbsp;If PoF is up, then use immediately otherwise try to
        avoid RP waste</span></li>
    <li><span>Howling Blast or DnD if you have 1 rune and less than 36 rp to try (Very
        minor, gets you an extra tick)</span></li>
    <li><span>Arcane torrent (With less than 60 RP)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h3 ><span>Priority list outside BoS</span></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Frost Strike to maintain IT/UF</span></li>
    <li><span>Remorseless Winter</span></li>
    <li><span>Frost strike if you won&rsquo;t waste a Rime or KM proc</span></li>
    <li><span>Rime if you wont waste KM</span></li>
    <li><span>Obliterate with KM</span></li>
    <li><span>Obliterate</span></li>
    <li><span>Frost strike</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h3 ><span>Resource Cooldowns</span></h3>
  <p><span>Frost has 4 major resource cooldowns: Empower Rune Weapon, Horn of Winter, Anti-magic
      Shell, and Anti-magic Zone. &nbsp;Understanding when to use them so as to not waste any of them is key to doing
      well on breath.</span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Horn of Winter is the simplest. &nbsp;While instead Breath, you use it
        when you have no Runes, i.e. you cannot press Obliterate and you have no Rime procs to consume with
        RotFC.</span></li>
    <li><span>Next easiest is AMZ, as this is usually assigned. &nbsp;If not assigned,
        you want to use it when your raid will take enough magic damage to use most of the AMZ. &nbsp;If given the
        choice of multiple points where this is true, then pick the spot that best matches where your resources will hit
        a lull. &nbsp;For example, on mythic Raszageth it was usually best to AMZ on the second Hurricane Wing cast
        around 1:15 as the first cast would often cause RP to overcap and the third cast would necessitate using another
        resource cd early to still have breath up. &nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span>AMS is usually straightforward to use. &nbsp;To properly use it, you
        need to have some knowledge of what mechanics in the fight do magic damage. &nbsp;Your goal is to use AMS close
        to off cooldown so you don&rsquo;t lose casts, but also make sure you get a good use. &nbsp;For the last 2 tiers
        we have had magic damage heavy content so it has become standard to get a full use out of AMS.</span></li>
    <li><span>Lastly, ERW. &nbsp;This is the hardest cooldown to pin down exactly when
        to use. &nbsp;While the resources this grants are nice, its main benefit is the haste. &nbsp;To put it into
        context, if breath is close to dying, ERW is just 15 RP on activation with another 15 RP on the next tick in 5
        seconds. &nbsp;Because of this, you want to use ERW a bit before you start to really run dry on resources.
        &nbsp;The **sim** answer to this is to use ERW when you have less than 70 RP and less than 3 Runes.
        &nbsp;However, on some fights you can anticipate having to deal with a mechanic or heavy movement during your
        breath. &nbsp;In those situations, it is often advantageous to hold ERW and use it shortly before the mechanic
        to bolster your resources. &nbsp;My advice would be to start with the sim timings, and then adjust ERW if you
        hit a sticking point. &nbsp;Or, to look at some logs beforehand with a tool like lorrgs.io. &nbsp;Now to turn to
        the next topic, what to do with the second charge? &nbsp;In most situations, you should be using your first ERW
        with your first Pillar/Breath on pull with Bloodlust. &nbsp;Below I have presented my evidence for this. &nbsp;I
        need to stress the importance of this erw usage being lined up with lust. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></li>
    <li><span>Lust and AMS/AMS RP on</span><span
        style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 573.00px; height: 128.00px;"><img

          title=""></span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span
        style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 596.00px; height: 264.00px;"><img
          alt="" src="images/image6.png"

          title=""></span><span
        style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 579.00px; height: 256.00px;"><img

          title=""></span></li>
    <li><span>There&rsquo;s an obvious difference here. &nbsp;Holding AMS is causing a
        noticeable dip in the burst peak at the start of the fight. &nbsp;Stacking haste buffs is very potent, as anyone
        who&rsquo;s played Unholy is aware and the same applies to frost. &nbsp;The extra haste in the lust window lets
        you cycle more GCDs in your pillar to stack it higher, and makes rolling your GS stacks into a new RW more
        consistent.</span></li>

          title=""></span></li>
    <li><span>Without lust on pull, the difference becomes slight. &nbsp;This would
        line up with a fight like Echo of Neltharion, where between the unlusted pull and frequent movement, you would
        want to save ERW.</span></li>

  <p><span>One final example just to emphasize that most of the gain is from stacking haste
      cooldowns.</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Stats</span></h2>
  <p><span>Before going any further, </span><span>SIM YOURSELF</span><span>.
      &nbsp;Numerous factors go into the value of each stat and trying to come up with a value is best left to using a
      computer to solve for each particular situation. &nbsp;Sometimes a general trend can be found, but this is not
      always the case. &nbsp;I will give the stats in no particular order </span></p>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Mastery: Simply increases our frost damage done. &nbsp;This only affects
        spells specific to us and will not increase frost damage from items or other effects that originate outside of
        the spec itself. &nbsp;It is often a better stat to pick up in AoE since our primary multi target spells are
        frost damage. &nbsp;We prefer mastery to versatility because of how mastery points work. &nbsp;It takes 180
        mastery rating to gain 1 mastery point, which converts to 2% mastery on your sheet. &nbsp;Versatility takes 205
        rating to gain 1% damage.</span></li>
    <li><span>Critical Strike: Does what it says on the tin but has some extra
        benefits for Frost. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s primary extra benefit is more crit gives more Killing Machine procs, and
        this means more chances for Murderous Efficiency procs for Runes. &nbsp;In Aberrus, the tier set amplifies our
        crits making it more valuable than it already was. &nbsp;This makes BoS build tend to want as much crit as it
        can get.</span></li>
    <li><span>Haste: Speeds up your auto attacks, GCD, and Rune regeneration rate. &nbsp;The
        primary benefit you will see is the sped up GCD. &nbsp;Rune regeneration is determined by (10 / 1 + haste).
        &nbsp;So with 10% haste we get a rune cooldown of (10 / 1 + .10) = 9.09s. &nbsp;This same formula governs GCD
        however. &nbsp;As we get Runes back faster, we can spend them faster. &nbsp;To illustrate this, I ran two sims,
        one with 1000 haste and one with 6000 </span><span
        style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 576.00px; height: 308.00px;"><img

          title=""></span><span
        style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 571.00px; height: 299.00px;"><img
          alt="" src="images/image7.png"
          style="width: 571.00px; height: 299.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);"

  </ul>
  <p><span>Can you guess which one has 6000? &nbsp;Its the first one. &nbsp;Being able to
      cycle resources so quickly leads to a lot of waiting from either being out of runes or full on RP. &nbsp;This
      point isn&rsquo;t to dissuade or downplay haste, just to dispel the rumor that DK has a lot of downtime without
      haste. &nbsp;Haste&rsquo;s main benefit to Frost is the faster GCD. &nbsp;I want to highlight two main benefits
      from this. &nbsp;First, it stacks Pillar of Frost&rsquo;s strength bonus higher and builds Enduring Strength.
      &nbsp;The other is it builds GS stacks faster and increases our ability to carryover stacks to the next cast of
      RW. &nbsp;</span></p>

  <ul>
    <li><span>Versatility: Not much to stay here. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a boring and expensive
        stat.</span></li>

  <h2 ><span>Gearing</span></h2>

        yourself</a></span><span>. &nbsp;All gearing can and should be handled by using Top Gear and Droptimizer to see
      what&rsquo;s going to be good for your specific character</span><span>. &nbsp;I will briefly cover what
      you&rsquo;re looking for in terms of crafting your sparks and if you need to insist on anything being good for you
      to your loot council:</span></p>
  <p><span>Craft boots and belt, put shadowflame patch on them.</span></p>
  <p><span>Craft weapon</span></p>
  <p><span>Craft ring</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <p><span>Class trinket and OCE are very good for us.</span></p>
  <p><span></span></p>
  <h2 ><span>Consumes</span></h2>
  <p><span>Phial of Corrupting Rage is incredibly good for us. &nbsp;Do not let your healers bully
      you into vers. &nbsp;Dropping this Phial would like taking off a mythic ilvl weapon and replacing it with a normal
      ilvl weapon. &nbsp;Buzzing Rune for your temporary enchant. &nbsp;Sim yourself for gems and enchants.
      &nbsp;Runeforges are Fallen Crusader and Hysteria. &nbsp;</span></p>
